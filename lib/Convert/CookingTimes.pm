=head1 NAME

Convert::CookingTimes - work out cooking times adjusted for temperature


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Given a set of item names, temperatures and durations, works out the average
temperature and adjusts the times to suit that temperature, then returns a list
of suggested timings.


    my ($temperature, @steps) = @steps = Convert::CookingTimes->adjust_times(
        { name => 'Chicken breasts', temp => 200, time => 20 },
        { name => 'Chips', temp => 220, time = 25 },
    );
    say "Warm oven up to $temperature degrees first.";
    for my $step (@steps) {
        say "Put $step->{name} in the oven, and wait for $step->{time_until_next}";
    }

    # You can also feed the result of adjust_times to summarise_instructions to
    # provide a simple set of instructions, e.g.:
    say Convert::CookingTimes->summarise_instructions(
        Convert::CookingTimes->adjust_times(\@items)
    );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Often find yourself cooking a variety of things, the cooking instructions for
each requiring a different temperature and time?

This module attempts to work out the appropriate oven temperature as an average
of all the items, and adjusts their cooking times based on that temperature -
so if they're going to be at a higher temperature the time is reduced and vice
versa.

Results may vary - providing items with a wide variation of temperatures could
result in some foods being cooked at sub-optimal temperatures, and obviously you
need to sanity-check the results, and be particularly careful to check that meat
and poultry has reached a safe internal temperature etc.  This is an algorhythm,
not a cook!


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 adjust_times

Takes a list or arrayref of hashrefs, each of which contains details of an 
item being cooked, with the keys:

=over

=item name

The name of the item

=item temp

The temperature the item's cooking instructions call for, in degrees Celcius

=item time

The cooking time the item's cooking instructions call for, in minutes

=back

Returns a suggested oven temperature, and an arrayref of cooking times adjusted
to suit that temperature.

sub adjust_times {
    my $class = shift;
    my @items = ref $_[0] eq 'ARRAY' ? @{$_[0]} : @_;

    # First off: pick our desired temperature, as an average of all the
    # temperatures, rounded to the nearest 10
    my $desired_temp = Math::Round::nearest_ceil(10, 
        List::Util::sum(map { $_->{temp} } @items) / scalar @items
    );

    # Now, for each item, work out its adjusted time; group items by
    # adjusted_time, so if we have multiple items with the same time
    # requirement, they are merged (as they'll go in together)
    my %items_by_time;
    my @times;
    for my $item (@items) {
        my $adjusted_time = Math::Round::round(

        );
        push @{ $items_by_time{$adjusted_time} }, {

                ($item->{temp} * $item->{time}) / $desired_temp
            ),
        };

    # Finally, return the items, sorted by longest cooking duration first,
    # with the time until the next item should be started included

            name => conjunction(map { $_->{name} } @items),
            adjusted_time => $items[0]->{adjusted_time},
        };
        
        # Add time_until_next, if there are other items to come - find the next
        # item(s) by looking for the first time that's shorter than this one:
        my ($next_time) = grep { 
            $_ < $time 
        } sort { $b <=> $a} keys %items_by_time;
        if ($next_time) {
            $condensed_item->{time_until_next} 
                = $condensed_item->{adjusted_time}
                - $items_by_time{$next_time}[0]{adjusted_time};
        }
        push @output, $condensed_item;
    }
    
    return $desired_temp, \@output;    
}


=item summarise_instructions

Given the results of adjust_times, produce a list of instructions.

For instance:

  - Warm oven up to 200 degrees
  - Add Chicken Breasts, cook for 5 minutes
  - Add Oven Chips, cook for 20 minutes

Returns a list of instruction steps if called in list context, or that list
joined with newlines if called in scalar context.
