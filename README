NAME
    Convert::CookingTimes - work out cooking times adjusted for temperature

SYNOPSIS
    Given a set of item names, temperatures and durations, works out the
    average temperature and adjusts the times to suit that temperature, then
    returns a list of suggested timings.

        my ($temperature, @steps) = @steps = Convert::CookingTimes->adjust_times(
            { name => 'Chicken breasts', temp => 200, time => 20 },
            { name => 'Chips', temp => 220, time = 25 },
        );
        say "Warm oven up to $temperature degrees first.";
        for my $step (@steps) {
            say "Put $step->{name} in the oven, and wait for $step->{time_until_next}";
        }

        # You can also feed the result of adjust_times to summarise_instructions to
        # provide a simple set of instructions, e.g.:
        say Convert::CookingTimes->summarise_instructions(
            Convert::CookingTimes->adjust_times(\@items)
        );

DESCRIPTION
    Often find yourself cooking a variety of things, the cooking
    instructions for each requiring a different temperature and time?

    This module attempts to work out the appropriate oven temperature as an
    average of all the items, and adjusts their cooking times based on that
    temperature - so if they're going to be at a higher temperature the time
    is reduced and vice versa.

    Results may vary - providing items with a wide variation of temperatures
    could result in some foods being cooked at sub-optimal temperatures, and
    obviously you need to sanity-check the results, and be particularly
    careful to check that meat and poultry has reached a safe internal
    temperature etc. This is an algorhythm, not a cook!

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  adjust_times
    Takes a list or arrayref of hashrefs, each of which contains details of
    an item being cooked, with the keys:

    name
        The name of the item

    temp
        The temperature the item's cooking instructions call for, in degrees
        Celcius

    time
        The cooking time the item's cooking instructions call for, in
        minutes

    Returns a suggested oven temperature, and an arrayref of cooking times
    adjusted to suit that temperature.

    summarise_instructions
    Given the results of adjust_times, produce a list of instructions.

    For instance:

      - Warm oven up to 200 degrees
      - Add Chicken Breasts, cook for 5 minutes
      - Add Oven Chips, cook for 20 minutes

    Returns a list of instruction steps if called in list context, or that
    list joined with newlines if called in scalar context.
